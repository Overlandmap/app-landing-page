# Privacy Policy

Last Updated: October 27, 2024

## Introduction
This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your personal information when you use our application. We are committed to ensuring the privacy and security of your data.

## Information We Collect
We collect only the minimum information necessary to provide you with our services:
- Email address
- Username
- Password (stored in encrypted format)
- Purchase history related to itinerary packs
- User reviews

### User Reviews and Comments
When you write reviews or comments in our application:

Only your chosen display name will be shown publicly
Your email address is never displayed or shared
Your display name can be changed at any time through your account settings
Reviews and comments will remain under your display name even if you delete your account, but won't be associated to your e-mail anymore

## Third-Party Services
### Mapbox Services
Our application uses Mapbox for mapping services. As part of this integration:
- Mapbox may collect location data and usage information to provide mapping functionality
- This data collection is governed by Mapbox's privacy policy, which can be found at: https://www.mapbox.com/legal/privacy
- We recommend reviewing Mapbox's privacy policy to understand their data collection practices

### Location Services
Location services are used to:
- Display your current position on the map while following itineraries
- Provide accurate navigation guidance
- Enable real-time progress tracking on routes

To control location services:
1. During first app launch, you'll be asked to authorize location access "While Using the App"
2. You can later modify this setting:
   - iOS: Settings → Privacy → Location Services → [App Name]
   - Android: Settings → Apps → [App Name] → Permissions → Location

Important notes about location services:
- Location access is only required "while app in use"
- You can use the app without location services, but your current position won't be displayed on maps
- Location data is only used for real-time display and is not stored by our application
- Mapbox processes location data according to their privacy policy

## How We Use Your Information
Your information is used exclusively for:
1. Account creation and management
2. Authentication and security
3. Processing your itinerary pack purchases
4. Communicating essential service-related information

## Data Storage and Security
- All personal data is stored securely using industry-standard encryption protocols
- Passwords are hashed and encrypted
- Regular security audits are conducted to ensure data protection
- Data is stored on secure servers with restricted access

## Third-Party Sharing
We do not share, sell, rent, or trade your personal information with any third parties. Your data remains strictly within our application's ecosystem. The only exception is the location data collected by Mapbox as described in the "Third-Party Services" section.

## Data Retention
We retain your personal information only for as long as necessary to:
- Maintain your active account
